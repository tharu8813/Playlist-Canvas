# AutoMix's default analyzer (app/automix/analysis/basic.py) needs librosa
# and the native/JIT pieces of its dependency chain: numba's LLVM JIT
# (llvmlite), scipy's compiled extensions, scikit-learn, and soundfile's
# bundled libsndfile. collect_all mirrors the existing numpy approach above
# so PyInstaller finds their binaries/data even where a hooks-contrib entry
# does not already cover them.
#
# Sonara (song structure) is a ~2 MB Rust extension and ships too, as does the
# default analyzer: Beat This! (beats, ~23 MB) and Open-Unmix (vocals, ~9 MB)
# exported to int8 ONNX and run by onnxruntime (its PyInstaller hook collects
# the native runtime; see app/automix/analysis/beat_this_onnx.py). The PyTorch-based analyzers
# (Beat This!, Demucs) do NOT: they made the installer ~1 GB and pinned the
# CPU during first analysis. They are excluded below even when installed in
# the build venv, because PyInstaller would otherwise follow their
# function-level imports.
#
# collect_all only *warns* for a package that is not installed, which is how
# 1.2.0.6 shipped without librosa and silently lost AutoMix. A release build
# must fail instead.
