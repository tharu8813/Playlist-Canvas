"""Optional advanced AutoMix analyzer: Beat This! neural beat/downbeat tracking.

Beat This! (CPJKU/beat_this on GitHub and PyPI as ``beat-this``; MIT license
for both code and the pretrained weights -- confirmed from the upstream
README/LICENSE/pyproject.toml at integration time) gives genuinely
model-based downbeats instead of BasicAnalysisProvider's provisional "every
4th beat" 4/4 guess (see app/automix/analysis/basic.py's module docstring).
That provisional guess is exactly what BasicAnalysisProvider deliberately
caps at PROVISIONAL_METER_CONFIDENCE=0.3, below
TrackAnalysis.RELIABLE_METER_CONFIDENCE=0.5 -- so a real downbeat model is
what actually unlocks BEAT_MATCH-quality transitions in
app/automix/candidates.py, not a planner change.

``torch``/``beat_this`` are heavyweight, optional runtime dependencies (not
in requirements.txt -- see docs/automix-history/automix-phase1-dependency-evaluation.md's
"Beat This!" section for the original size/license evaluation) and are
imported lazily, inside _load_model(), only once analysis is actually
attempted -- never at module import time, matching the same principle
app/controllers/automix_analysis_controller.py already documents for
librosa. A missing/broken install, a failed/corrupted model download, or an
inference error for one track all degrade to BasicAnalysisProvider's own
result for that track: AutoMix, and the app as a whole, must keep working
with this engine completely absent.

This is a hybrid provider (key/energy/vocal-activity/validation/silence
handling are delegated to an owned BasicAnalysisProvider instance, not
reimplemented) -- Beat This! only ever replaces the rhythm fields (bpm,
bpm_confidence, beats, downbeats, meter_*).

Beat This! predicts beat and downbeat *timestamps*, not a time signature --
whether those downbeats actually imply a plausible, internally consistent
bar structure (e.g. not "every beat is also a downbeat," a degenerate
prediction a fully unaccented/homogeneous audio signal can produce) is
sanity-checked here (_estimate_meter_numerator/_meter_confidence) before
being reported as a usable meter. Model output itself is never
postprocessed/truncated to look more plausible (no "just take every 4th
downbeat"): an implausible or inconsistent bar structure is reported as
low confidence and/or an unknown meter_numerator, and the existing
degrade chain (candidates.py) is what falls back from there -- never a
hardcoded meter forced on the data.
