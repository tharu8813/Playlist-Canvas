"""AutoMix audio rendering: AudioRenderPlan -> one real mixed audio file.

Architecture boundary (roadmap Phase 5 section 1): this is a standalone
audio pipeline, deliberately not wired into FFmpegRenderer.render()'s
existing legacy normalize/silence/concat path. That path is untouched by
this module and keeps producing byte-identical output for every existing
(non-AutoMix) export -- "regression equivalence matters more than
architectural purity" (section 3). Wiring an enabled/disabled switch into
the production export button belongs to Phase 6, where the settings/UI
toggle that would drive the choice actually lives.

Filter graph strategy (section 7): rather than one global adelay+amix
graph, each clip is trimmed/rate-adjusted/gained in isolation and the
result is folded left-to-right with the SAME operation the legacy
sequential pipeline already uses at each junction -- concat for plain
adjacency, a silence-padded concat for an explicit gap, or FFmpeg's
``acrossfade`` filter for a planned transition. acrossfade's own
``duration`` parameter reproduces a transition's overlap directly, so no
manual global-timeline delay bookkeeping is needed at all. This keeps the
graph readable and lets it scale to many tracks as one filter_complex
chain instead of one delay-position per input. A transition carrying a
DSP style (``AudioRenderTransition.dsp``, chosen by the planner; BEAT_MATCH
defaults to bass swap) adds band envelopes and a window limiter on top of
the same acrossfade overlap (see BAND_ENVELOPES below); a transition
without one renders exactly as before.

# Band DSP for styled transitions (BASS_SWAP / VOCAL_SAFE_EQ / FILTER_BLEND). Each participating clip is split

# DJ mixer's EQ is always in circuit): LR bands sum back to an allpass, so a
# clip with every band at unity keeps a flat magnitude response, and running
# the filter continuously avoids the waveform jump that splicing raw audio
# against its phase-shifted crossover output would cause at a window edge.
# Each band then gets its own fade envelope, so the fold only has to sum the
# overlap (acrossfade curve "nofade") -- keeping acrossfade's exact-duration
# overlap semantics unchanged from every other transition type.
#
# Deliberate Phase 1 trade-off: the crossover covers the whole clip, so a clip
# that is BEAT_MATCH on one side and CROSSFADE/CUT/gap on the other still plays
# the crossover-recombined signal end to end -- including across that other
# junction. Magnitude response stays flat (+/-0.5 dB measured), but the phase is
# altered. Restricting the crossover to the transition window instead would
# splice raw audio against its phase-shifted recombination and click.
