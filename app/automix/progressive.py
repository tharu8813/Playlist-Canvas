"""Progressive AutoMix for Preview: apply transitions as analysis completes.

Pure policy, no Qt, no FFmpeg -- the Qt shell lives in
``app.controllers.progressive_automix_controller``.

Why a partial plan is safe to play: ``compile_automix`` places tracks
strictly left to right, and a pair whose analysis is missing falls back to
plain sequential adjacency. Compiling the *full* track list with analyses for
only the analyzed prefix therefore yields "AutoMix up to the frontier,
sequential after it", and every transition it plans is already exactly the
one the final, fully analyzed plan will contain -- later analyses only
append, they never move an earlier transition. The one thing a new
transition changes is the previous clip's tail (its outgoing cue), which is
exactly where :func:`divergence_seconds` places the first difference.

Render policy (the O(n^2) guard): analysis and planning react to every
event, rendering does not. A partial mix is rendered only when the listener
is about to reach a junction whose AutoMix audio is not rendered yet, after a
short debounce so bursts of analysis events collapse into one render, and
never while another render is running. Once analysis is complete the partial
path stops and the unmodified export pipeline renders the final mix.
