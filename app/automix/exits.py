"""Phrase exits: how to leave a track the next one cannot be beat-matched with.

Two tracks too far apart in tempo cannot share their beats, and a plain
3-second fade at the very end is the same move every time. A DJ instead
leaves the outgoing track on a phrase boundary with a move that needs no
shared tempo, chosen by what the music is doing there:

- ECHO_OUT (the default): the track plays to its last downbeat; that final
  hit sounds and then only its echo rings on, under the next track's first
  downbeat -- the echo comes in as the song ends, not a phrase before it.
- DOWNBEAT_CUT: both sides are drum-driven at about the same energy -- cut
  straight from one downbeat to the other and keep the momentum.
- TAPE_STOP: the energy drops a long way into the next track -- a turntable
  brake marks the change instead of blurring it.

A track whose own ending is natural (a final chord ringing out for
NATURAL_ENDING_SECONDS after its decay starts) keeps it: the regular
fade/drop-in plays that ending. Otherwise at most MAX_SKIPPED_SECONDS of the
song is left out. Pure and deterministic, like the planner.
