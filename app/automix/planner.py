"""AutoMixPlanner: Timeline + analyses + settings -> CompiledRenderPlan.

Preview and Export never see how a transition was decided (roadmap Phase 4
section 1) -- they only ever read a CompiledRenderPlan, exactly as they do
for the Sequential compiler in app/timeline/compiler.py. This module is a
second, independent producer of that same shape; it does not touch
compile_timeline()/compile_playlist() at all, so legacy (non-AutoMix)
playback is provably unaffected by anything here.

Tempo policy (DJ-style): every track plays at its own tempo from its first
beat until its last bars. For BEAT_MATCH the *outgoing* track eases onto
the incoming track's tempo over up to RAMP_BARS bars before their overlap
(AudioRenderClip.tempo_ramp) and holds it through the overlap; the
incoming track never changes speed. An earlier policy instead played the
whole incoming track at the outgoing tempo, which then carried into the
next pair, so a playlist drifted further from its tracks' real tempos with
every transition and never came back.

Silence: the first track starts at its first sound, the last stops at its
last, and a CUT or unplanned junction butts the two sounds together.

Candidate duration is authoritative (Commit C.1): the planner applies
`TransitionCandidate.duration_seconds` and `outgoing_source_out` directly.
Candidates now retain the audible outgoing ending and finalize their actual
source span and timeline duration before scoring. An early structure hint
cannot discard the remaining audio or inflate the rendered overlap after
scoring. Presentation and chapter ownership still follow transition starts.

    verbatim rather than being overlapped into (roadmap section 12: "For
