"""Background AutoMix analysis for the currently loaded playlist.

Runs off the GUI thread (roadmap Phase 1 section 7 / Phase 6 section 4:
"Do not freeze the UI"). Results here are session-only, in-memory display
data for MainWindow's playlist badges and track-details panel -- the
durable, cross-session cache is AnalysisCache (app/automix/cache.py);
this controller only orchestrates one background pass over the current
playlist and reports what came back.

``app.automix.analysis.basic`` (and, through it, ``librosa`` and its
dependency chain) is imported lazily, inside the worker thread's own
``run()``, not at module scope. AutoMix is optional -- the roadmap's
"keep the basic engine usable" rule extends to "installing the app at
all": MainWindow imports this controller unconditionally at startup, so
a top-level ``import librosa`` here would make a missing/broken librosa
installation prevent the entire application from launching, not just
AutoMix.
