Timeline is the editing model: what the user placed. CompiledRenderPlan is
the execution model: exactly how a compiler resolved that Timeline into
audio placement, visual ownership, and chapter metadata. Preview and Export

differently from each other.

No Qt, no FFmpeg, no subprocess, no file I/O here on purpose -- this sits
